# random wikipedia newtab
Firefox extension that redirects to a random wikipedia page when you open a new tab, because when you're opening a new tab you're looking for a distraction and that distraction might as well be a weird fact

## this is the way I'm developing extensions although you can certainly do it without npm

1. install npm

2. install web-ext: `npm install --global web-ext`

3. run in project folder: `web-ext run`

4. navigate to `about:addons` in the firefox window that opens. click extensions. it's installed :D extension will auto update as you save files in the project.
